# Model-Portfolio-using-mean-variance

Implementation of portfolio optimization using the Markowitz mean-variance model. The program uses the pandas library to read a CSV file containing financial data and calculates the expected returns and covariance matrix of the assets in the portfolio. The program then defines the risk tolerance levels for the portfolio and solves an optimization problem using the CVXPY library to find the optimal weights for each asset in the portfolio. The program generates a plot of the efficient frontier, which shows the set of portfolios that provide the highest expected return for a given level of risk. The plot also highlights the portfolios generated for each risk tolerance level specified. The code can be useful for individuals and organizations looking to optimize their investment portfolios by balancing risk and returns.
